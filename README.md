The motivation behind creating a Student Calendar Notifier stems from the need to help
students manage both their academic and personal lives more effectively. Students often juggle
multiple responsibilities—such as assignment deadlines, exam dates, extracurricular activities,
and social events—while also trying to remember important personal dates like birthdays and
holidays. Without an effective system in place, it’s easy for important dates to be forgotten,
leading to stress, missed opportunities, or even academic penalties.
The motivation to create a Birthday Calendar for students comes from the desire to help students
foster and maintain meaningful relationships while balancing their academic responsibilities.
Birthdays are significant social events that allow students to celebrate with friends and peers, yet
amidst the chaos of academic deadlines and schedules, students often forget or miss these special
dates.
The Birthday Calendar aims to address this by providing students with a simple, automated way to
remember birthdays. This system ensures that students stay connected with their social circles,
acknowledging milestones like birthdays without the stress of having to manually track them. By
receiving timely reminders, students can plan small celebrations, send greetings, or even organize
group gifts—actions that strengthen friendships and contribute to a more positive social experience
during their academic journey. At the end of the day, the goal is to help students stay connected with
their friends and make sure they don’t miss any important celebrations.
